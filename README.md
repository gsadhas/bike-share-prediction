Predict bike share using simple neural network. Neural network was implemented using Numpy python library. 

# Dataset
The bike share dataset used in the project is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset

# Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- unittest

# How to run
- [dnn.py](../master/dnn.py) file contains necessary forward, backpropagation, train and inference modules
- Please check the notebook [bike-share-prediction.ipynb](../master/bike-share-prediction.ipynb) that includes detailed steps to build, train and analysis the network
